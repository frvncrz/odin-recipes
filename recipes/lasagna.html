        <h3 class="ingredients-title">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>1lb of meat (I prefer higher fat ratio. Fat is flavor!)</li>
            <li>16oz of cottage cheese</li>
            <li>24oz of pasta sauce, preferablly meat flavored or basil and garlic flavor</li>
            <li>Seasoning: Salt, pepper, paprika, chili powder</li>
            <li>Fresh garlic and shallots</li>
            <li>Block of cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="steps-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Season meat with a pinch of salt and pepper, 1tb paprika and chili powder, mix it all in and set in refridgerator for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the meat is being chilled, bring a pot of water to boil adding a pinch of salt and once water is at full boil, add lasagna till soft enough that it doesn't stick to each other.</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese into a bowl with dried basil, pinch of salt and parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Preheat pan and set oven to about 350-375,  mince 3 cloves of garlic and 1 whole shallot. Add a layer of olive oil to pan and sweat the garlic and shallots till soft (not brown or burnt!! AGHH!!)</li>
            <li>At this point you can add the meat till complately browned and slowly add the pasta sauce (save at least half of the pasta sauce as we'll need it for later)</li>
            <li>Time to assemble in this order: lasagna, cottage cheese, meat filling, pasta sauce, and shredded cheddar cheese. Repeat this step until baking pan is filled to the rim and top it off with more shredded cheddar.</li>
            <li>Lastly, bake in oven for about 20-30 minutes or until you see the cheddar cheese start to brown into a crust.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bonus-step">Ultimate bonus step: let it rest until room temp to get all the sauce to settle so it will be easier to slice and serve without a mess!</p>
