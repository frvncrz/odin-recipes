      <h3 class="steps-title">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring pot of water up to a boil, then add your elbow macaroni with a
          pinch of salt
        </li>
        <li>
          While the macaroni are boiling, add 2 cartons of heavy cream into a
          sauce pan and stir until heated(don't stop mixing or the bottom of the
          sauce pan will burn).
        </li>
        <li>
          Now add your seasoning blend, pinch of salt, 1tbs of parika, garlic
          powder, onion, powder, and pepper. Mix until well incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
          At this point the macaroni should be cooked through and soft, drain
          the water but keep some of the macaroni water to the side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the pre-shredded cheddar and mozerella into the heavy cream, mix
          until all cheese has been well mixed and sauce thickens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Into a backing dish, pour in your macaroni, if it seems stuck
          together, use some of the left over water we set aside. Slowly pour in
          the cheese sauce, mix until evey macaroni is covered in cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you put it in the oven, you can either put bread crumbs,
          crushed ritz crackers, or more cheese on top. Whatever option you go
          with, bake the mac n cheese for 20-25 minutes until top is golden
          brown.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="bonus-step">
        Bonus Step: If you want some spice, you can add a bit of Franks Red Hot
        Sauce for a buffalo chicken mac n cheese!
